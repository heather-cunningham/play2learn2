# Play2Learn2 Class Project 2
# A Node.js, Bootstrap.js, & Vue.js Web App
## North Shore Community College's: 
## Full Stack Software Developer Program

### Class Project Instructions
* For this project, modify the Node.js Play2Learn web app built in the first project to use Bootstrap 
for all layout, except the Math Facts game. 
* Then, build out the Anagram Hunt game using Vue.js.

### Instructions to Run the Project Locally
* In a terminal, navigate to the root of the Node.js web app, and run command `node app.js`.
* The project listens to port 8080.
* Node.js serves up the Vue.js Anagram Hunt game.  
* You should not need to run Vue's command `npm run serve`.  

#### If you wish to run only the Vue.js Anagram Hunt game locally:
* In a terminal, navigate to the root of the Anagram Hunt Vue game.
* Run command `npm run serve`.

### Games in this Project:
* Math Facts - a Node.js web app/game for practicing arithmetic operations
* Anagram Hunt - a Vue.js SPA/game embedded into the Node.js web app and served up by Node.js
